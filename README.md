# LIBFT-PRINTF-GNL
This is a personal library used for 42 projects, which often don't let you use libraries outside of <stdio.h> or <unistd.h>.


Milestone 0 includes the project of Libft and Milestone 1 includes the projects of ft_printf, get_next_line and Born2BeRoot (a virtual machine I can't upload to git). Since the three projects are basically replicating already existing functions to understand how they work, and you are allowed to mix them all to make a library to use in bigger projects, I decided to put them all together in the same repo.


This repo does not comply with 42's formatting rules. I did these projects back in late 2024 and have been rewriting them as of September 2025 with a better understanding of C. This rewrite completely ignores "norminette" (42's formatting rules) and the subject guidelines about the amount of files and their names. Otherwise, the functions are the same as the ones I originally submitted.
